# LANGUAGE

inherits: canonic-canonic/FOUNDATION

---

## Axiom

**PEOPLE govern. MACHINE executes. DESIGN speaks STRUCTURE.**

---

## TRIAD

```
CANON.md  = governance (what you believe)
VOCAB.md  = definitions (the words you use)
README.md = interface (what people see)
```

---

## SPEC

```
{SCOPE} = TRIAD
```

---

## Identity

```
CANONIC  = LANGUAGE
LANGUAGE = Gated State Machine
MAGIC    = CANONIC ∩ LANGUAGE ∩ LEARNING
```

---

## Constraints

```
MUST:     Define all governance terms in VOCAB.md
MUST:     Maintain TRIAD integrity (CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md)
SHOULD:   Express structure through DESIGN — visual language is governance
MUST NOT: Introduce ungoverned vocabulary into active governance files
```

---

## Roadmap

- Now: Spec closed, 66 terms, drift detection, self-compliance check
- Next: Constraint conflict resolution, arXiv publication
- Later: DAO governance, multi-stakeholder voting, versioning
