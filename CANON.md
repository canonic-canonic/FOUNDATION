# CANONIC-FOUNDATION — CANON

inherits: canonic-canonic/FOUNDATION

---

## Axiom

**SPEC = {SCOPE}. The LANGUAGE. The v0 discovery.**

FOUNDATION defines the LANGUAGE. Three axioms. Compiler correspondence. The paper proves itself.

---

## Constraints

```
MUST:     LANGUAGE defines all governance primitives
MUST:     Every scope inherits from FOUNDATION
MUST:     Triad (CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md) in every scope
MUST NOT: Define terms outside VOCAB.md
MUST NOT: Hardcode outside the kernel
SHOULD:   Vocabulary closure — every term resolves to a definition
```
