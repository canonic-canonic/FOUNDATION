# CANONIC-FOUNDATION — CANON

inherits: canonic-canonic/FOUNDATION

---

## Axiom

**SPEC = {SCOPE}. The LANGUAGE. The v0 discovery.**

FOUNDATION defines the LANGUAGE. Three axioms. Compiler correspondence. The paper proves itself.

---

## Structure

```
canonic-foundation/
  CANON.md          ← this file (org root)
  VOCAB.md          ← vocabulary
  ROADMAP.md        ← temporal record
  LANGUAGE/         ← the language definition
  IDIOMS/           ← governance patterns
  PROGRAMMING/      ← language implementations (c, python, swift)
  SHOP/             ← publishing pipeline (paper, blog, book)
```

---

## Three Axioms

```
TRIAD          = CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md
INHERITANCE    = inherits: chains. Children refine parents.
INTROSPECTION  = The system validates itself. Vocabulary closure.
```

**TRIAD + INHERITANCE + INTROSPECTION ≅ SYNTAX + SCOPE + TYPE SYSTEM.**

---

## Constraints

```
MUST:     LANGUAGE defines all governance primitives
MUST:     Every scope inherits from FOUNDATION
MUST:     Triad (CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md) in every scope
MUST NOT: Define terms outside VOCAB.md
MUST NOT: Hardcode outside the kernel
SHOULD:   Vocabulary closure — every term resolves to a definition
```
